I am a graduate student at the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://www.wisc.edu), working for the [Simulation-Based Engineering Lab](http://sbel.wisc.edu) and [Wisconsin Applied Computing Center](http://wacc.wisc.edu). Most of my time is spent acting as the sysadmin for the Center's CPU+GPU research cluster.
